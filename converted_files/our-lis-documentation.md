Private dwellings include houses, flats, home units, caravans, garages, tents and other structures that were used as places of residence at the time of interview (including long-stay caravan parks); are thus excluded hotels, boarding schools, boarding houses and institutions. Usual residents excludes: households which contain members of non-Australian defense forces stationed in Australia, and households which contain diplomatic personnel of overseas governments. The exclusion of very remote areas has only a minor impact on any aggregate estimates.                                                              |

Besides, the original survey provides 60 replicate weights per record; those were however not used by LIS. | Final weights are calculated through an iterative procedure in which initial weights (inverse of the probability of selection) are adjusted by a calibration process to ensure that survey estimates conform to independently estimated benchmarks (numbers of persons aged 15 and over, numbers of children under age 15, numbers of households, and the value of government benefit cash transfers). The weighting factors exist both at household level and person level and the vast majority of household members have been assigned the same value as the household weight.
