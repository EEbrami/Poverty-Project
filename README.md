# Poverty and the Promises of Globalism: A Cross-National Analysis

## Project Description

This project, undertaken in collaboration with Dr. Miles Corak, examines the promises of globalism through a detailed analysis of poverty across countries and over time. Utilizing Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) microdata, we aim to harmonize and standardize poverty indicators and socioeconomic variables to facilitate robust, cross-national analyses of poverty trends and the impact of various policies. This work will serve as a valuable resource for both academic research and evidence-based policy evaluation on a global scale.

## Objectives

* **Standardize Key Variables:** Develop a consistent and well-documented framework for standardizing key socioeconomic variables from the LIS datasets.
* **Document Data Harmonization:** Create comprehensive documentation of the harmonization process, ensuring transparency and replicability of our findings.
* **Analyze Poverty Trends:** Conduct in-depth, cross-national analyses of poverty trends, drawing on the harmonized LIS microdata.
* **Evaluate Policy Impacts:** Assess the impact of various social and economic policies on poverty, using our standardized dataset to draw meaningful comparisons.

## Impact and Applications

This project serves to:

* **Advance Academic Research:** Provide a robust, harmonized dataset and analytical framework for researchers studying global poverty and inequality.
* **Inform Policy Evaluation:** Offer policymakers a tool for evidence-based assessment of poverty alleviation programs and policies.
* **Enable Comparative Studies:** Facilitate cross-national and cross-temporal comparisons of poverty and the effectiveness of different policy interventions.
* **Promote Data-Driven Decision-Making:** Support strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and policy design in the global effort to reduce poverty.
