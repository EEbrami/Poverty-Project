H & I,HID,household identifier,,Unique (within dataset) household number.,"For confidentiality reasons, this identifier differs from the original one.
Necessary when merging household and person file.  This identifier is unique only within each country/year dataset; when combining different countries or years it is necessary to use it in combination with the variable DID in order to uniquely identify households."

Please note that the income reference year may differ from the year following which the survey was named by the data provider, and/or the year in which the survey was conducted."
H,HPOPWGT,household weight,,Population household cross-sectional weight: this weight inflates the result to reflect the total household population covered by the dataset.,"This variable is always filled for all observations. 
Always use the weight in your analysis in order to get results representative of the total population.
In case of multi-country analysis, the inflated weight should be chosen if each country is intended to count in the final results proportionately to its population size."
I,PPOPWGT,person weight,,Population individual cross-sectional weight: this weight inflates the result to reflect the total individual population covered by the dataset.,"This variable is always filled for all observations. In many datasets the individual and the household-level weight are the same.
Always use the individual weight in your individual level analysis in order to get results representative of the total individual population.
In case of multi-country analysis, the inflated weight should be chosen if each country is intended to count in the final results proportionately to its population size."
H,HWGT,normalised household weight,,"Household-level cross-sectional weight, normalised to 10,000 by country.","This variable is always filled for all observations. 
Always use the household weight in your household level analysis in order to get results representative of the total household population.
In case of multi-country analysis, the normalized weight should be chosen if each country is intended to have the same weight."
I,PWGT,normalised person weight,,"Individual-level cross-sectional weight, normalised to 10,000 by country.","This variable is always filled for all observations. In many datasets the individual and the household-level weight are the same.
Always use the individual weight in your individual level analysis in order to get results representative of the total individual population.
In case of multi-country analysis, the normalized weight should be chosen if each country is intended to have the same weight."
H,HWGTA,additional household weight,,Additional household level weight calculated for a selected sub-sample of households.,This variable contains an additional household level weight in case only part of the household sample has been selected for some variables. This weight should be used only in connection with the sub-sample for which it was created.
I,PWGTA,additional person weight,,Additional individual level weight calculated for a selected sub-sample of individuals.,This variable contains an additional individual level weight in case only part of the individual sample has been selected for some variables.
