For these reasons, they are excluded from DHI.

Specifically, we do not include non-cash transfers in the areas of housing, care (including child care), education, or health. These transfers are very hard to evaluate at the individual level and thus are typically only available at the macro-level.

We exclude means-tested public benefits in cases where they form a portion of a system in which benefits are granted to the whole population (poor and non-poor), although using different tools and programs. For example, in the case of health insurance in the U.S., we have excluded benefits received through the Medicaid program (which provides health insurance to low-income Americans) because most persons who do not receive Medicaid are subsidized either through the U.S. tax system – if employed – or through Medicare (the social insurance program for the elderly and persons with disabilities). |

We exclude means-tested public benefits in cases where they form a portion of a system in which benefits are granted to the whole population (poor and non-poor), although using different tools and programs. For example, in the case of health insurance in the U.S., we have excluded benefits received through the Medicaid program (which provides health insurance to low-income Americans) because most persons who do not receive Medicaid are subsidized either through the U.S. tax system – if employed – or through Medicare (the social insurance program for the elderly and persons with disabilities). |

These transfers are very hard to evaluate at the individual level and thus are typically only available at the macro-level. Thus, the value of these transfers is also excluded from DHI and, these non-cash incomes are not available in the LIS microdata.                                                                                                                                              |

We exclude means-tested public benefits in cases where they form a portion of a system in which benefits are granted to the whole population (poor and non-poor), although using different tools and programs. For example, in the case of health insurance in the U.S., we have excluded benefits received through the Medicaid program (which provides health insurance to low-income Americans) because most persons who do not receive Medicaid are subsidized either through the U.S. tax system – if employed – or through Medicare (the social insurance program for the elderly and persons with disabilities). |
