| H      | OWN     | main residence tenure status | . missing                           | Indicator of housing tenure distinguishing between owned and non-owned dwelling. If additional information is available, further distinctions are made among homeowners, identifying those still paying a mortgage versus those who own their home outright. For non-owners, a distinction is made between those paying rent (either at market price or below market price) and those living rent-free. | Note that the 'below market price' category refers to households paying rent lower than the market rate, and does not identify households receiving housing subsidies or allowances. |
