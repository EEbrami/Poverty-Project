LISSY is a remote-execution system that allows researchers to access [LIS](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/) and [LWS](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lws/) microdata from a remote location while adhering to the privacy restrictions mandated by the countries providing the data. It offers secure access to the microdata through a web-based [Job Submission Interface](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

## How to Get Started with LISSY?

Users write and submit statistical programs written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [SAS](https://www.sas.com/), [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics), or [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) through the [LISSY interface](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/) (Batch coding mode). LISSY automatically processes the jobs and typically returns aggregated results to users within a few minutes.

To ensure proper processing of user requests, LISSY requires a few exceptions to the standard statistical program syntax.
