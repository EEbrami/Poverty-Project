## Aggregates

### Equivalised Disposable Household Income

Equivalised Disposable Household Income refers to cash and non-cash income from labour, income from capital, income from pensions (including private and public pensions) and non-pension public social benefits stemming from insurance, universal or assistance schemes (including in-kind social assistance transfers), as well as cash and non-cash private transfers, after deduction of the amount of income taxes and social contributions paid. Disposable Household Income is equivalised at individual level as the total amount divided by the square root of household members. Before equivalisation, top and bottom coding has been applied by setting boundaries for extreme values of log transformed Disposable Household Income: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.

### Equivalised Market Household Income

Equivalised Market Household Income refers to income received by the households before public redistribution takes place; it includes cash and non-cash income from labour, income from capital, income from private pensions, as well as cash and non-cash private transfers, before deduction of income taxes and social contributions paid. Market Household Income is equivalised at individual level as the total amount divided by the square root of household members. Before equivalisation, top and bottom coding has been applied by setting boundaries for extreme values of log transformed Market Household Income: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.

### Equivalised Market Household Income (including contributory transfers)

Equivalised Market Household Income (including contributory transfers) refers to income received by the households before public redistribution takes place, whereby contributory transfers are treated as deferred labour income; it includes cash and non-cash income from labour, income from capital, income from private pensions, cash and non-cash private transfers, as well as income from contributory transfers, after deduction of social contributions paid, before deduction of income taxes paid. Market Household Income (including contributory transfers) is equivalised at individual level as the total amount divided by the square root of household members. Before equivalisation, top and bottom coding has been applied by setting boundaries for extreme values of log transformed Market Household Income (including contributory transfers): at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.

### Gross Wages

Gross Wages refers to monetary payments received from regular and irregular dependent employment. This includes cash wage and salary income and monetary supplements to the basic wage, such as overtime pay, employer bonuses, 13th month bonus, profit-share, tips before deduction of income taxes and social contributions. Estimates refer to wage earners aged 16-64 who have non-zero wages. Top and bottom coding has been applied by setting boundaries for extreme values of log transformed Gross wages: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.

## Indicators available in ‘trends’, ‘scatter plots’, and ‘maps’

### Median (PPP in $US)
Median (PPP in $US) is the amount that divides the selected population into two equal groups, half with income above this value and half below. Conversion to International Dollars follows the PPP conversion factors for 2017 and Consumer Price Indexes (CPIs) from the World Bank Development Indicators; values refer to 2017 PPPs (in 2017 $US).

### Relative Poverty Rate at 50% of the Median
Relative Poverty Rate at 50% of the Median is the percentage of the population whose income falls below the poverty line as defined as half of the median of equivalised disposable household income. In combination with decompositions, the ratio refers to the percentage of each group, whose income falls below the above defined poverty line.

## Decompositions in combination with aggregate Equivalised Disposable Household Income and Equivalised Market Household Income

### Income Deciles
Decomposition by Income Deciles splits the total population in ten population groups equal in size, while applying household weighting factors multiplied by the number of persons. The 1st income decile is defined as the population group with the lowest equivalised disposable household income, respectively the 10th income decile refers to the population group with the highest.

### Household Type
Decomposition by Household Type splits the total population in five groups: One person households, Couples without children, Couples with children, Single parents, and Other family / non-family households. Children are defined as own children, step-children, or foster children of the head aged 17 or younger. Households with only the nuclear family (head & spouse plus children / head plus children), where both children aged 17 or younger and children 18 or older are present, are still included in Couples with children / Single parents. When there are nuclear families with only adult children of the head, then they are included in category Other family / non-family households. Households which consist of nuclear families and other relatives or non-relatives are all included in category Other family / non-family households.

### Homeownership
Decomposition by Homeownership splits the total population in two groups: Homeowners and Not homeowners.

### Urban vs. Rural
Decomposition by Urban vs. Rural splits the total population according to their geographic area: those living in Urban area and those living in Rural area. Categorisation in urban vs. rural areas follows typically national definitions.
